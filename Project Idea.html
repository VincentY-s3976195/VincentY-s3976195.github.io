            <h1>Project Idea</h1>
                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>My project idea is that I will be creating a website for myself and my family.  It is a website where we record interesting moments or things 
                       happening in our daily lives.  Also, it is a place where we can talk about all the topics we are interested in, what is going on around the world
                       and information that we are interested in as well.  Sometimes, we will also post some inspiring or engaging challenges there to change or improve
                       ourselves.  And it is a place we record our first baby from the first day of his born onwards.</p>
                    <h3>Motivation</h3>
                    <p>I am always motivated to create my own work as I was a drummer in a band that had run for almost nine years, and we recorded albums and live 
                       videos in Taiwan.  I enjoy playing music, creating my own work, and sharing it with people so I can have different experiences and achievements 
                       with fame.  However, my pursuit of fame stopped when I left my band and came to Australia to follow my other dream of living abroad.   
                       I still have an interest in creating content and sharing my tiny little experience in my life with people around the world in the hope of being 
                       so-called influencers.  Most importantly, if possible, I want to record all these precious memories and experiences so that I can review them when
                       I am older and my offspring can see them. </p>
                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>For content-wise, the website will include our basic information and background at first.  The content comprises our daily experiences, things 
                       that happened in our everyday life, and news and topics we are interested in will be displayed through vlogs and blogs.  Therefore, we will have 
                       another website joined: YouTube, because we will also be posting our videos there, and the links will be shared on both websites so that people can
                       be directed and view more information we share.  
                       Not only for our vlogs and blogs, but we also have other features or topics that will be posted on our platform as below.
                       
                       <li><b>Plans or challenges</b>- interesting plans or challenges such as creating a new habit, building a new skill, weight loss, or building a muscle mass plan.</li>
                       <li><b>Share information</b>- for example, we love travelling, so we will post and update our travel blogs/ vlogs and collect any information required and travel 
                            tips there.  It can be music or fitness or technology etc.</li>  
                       <li><b>Record of our baby's growth</b>- photos or videos and words and messages that we would like to speak to our baby.</li> 
                       <li><b>Work discussion</b>- discuss our job and share our work experience.  Also, we discuss personal improvement and fulfilment and accomplishment in work or life.</li>  
                       <li><b>Expressing own feelings and viewpoints on different things or topics.</b></li>
                       <li><b>When ready, we will post commercials to share our products or services.</b>  In other words, we will also try to run our little online business.  And as 
                          I have said earlier, I am a drummer, so that I will offer drums tutoring for people interested in drums.</li> 
                       So far, we have thought about these topics we would like to work on.  I think as time goes by, we have different experiences at various stages of life.  
                       We will have more and other topics that we want to share.   
                       For website-wise, it includes the design for the websites and the user experience and other factors that need to be considered throughout the process.  
                       Right now, it is difficult to describe as my skills are still limited.  However, it will be in progress throughout the learning process.</p>
                    <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>  
                    <p>For me to create a website and film videos, knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and software for film editing is required.  
                       For creating a website or web development, although the above knowledge is required as they are the backbone and fundamental for web development, 
                       I will try to learn programming languages such as Python, PHP and Ruby to build up my skills.  
                       Filming videos requires editing programs and a camera or mobile phone and microphones.</p>
                    <h3>Skills Required </h3>
                    <p>As for creating a website, the ability to write HTML, CSS and JavaScript are necessary.  As for the hardware, it is not required but the computer 
                       and the internet.  
                       As for filming videos, software for editing is a must.  Film editing skill is also required, as you can see the main difference between a novice 
                       and a proficient editor and the effect and quality of the video.   As for the hardware, a camera, mobile phone, microphone, and laptop/desktop are 
                       necessary.</p>
                    <h3>Outcome</h3>
                    <p>If the project is successful, the outcome is that this website will be a complete platform and stage for us and a YouTube channel.  And if it could
                       work that we can gain audiences and subscribers, we can consider putting more time in here and taking it as our part-time business.  Overall, we
                       intend to be the content creators that create our work and a platform that can record our everyday experiences and a diary for our baby's growth.
                       The original problem is the lack of skills to create a website and film videos which will be solved over time.  As for the impact on development,
                       I think our life will be different than it used to be but in a good, engaging, and challenging way.</p>
