            <h3>What do the results of these tests mean for you</h3>
            <p>After analysing the information from the test results of the Myers-Briggs personality test regarding myself, I have found some of the traits about myself 
                that I have never realised and thought I would have until now. I thought this test was a bit inaccurate.  Furthermore, I have done another test called 
                the Big five test, and most of the facts are genuinely accurate between these two tests.  The results of these two tests show the most similar points: 
                I am an altruistic extrovert who loves to help others to improve not only themselves but myself, and I enjoy being in teamwork that instead has social 
                harmony than conflict.  An artist who has a creative and imaginative mind and strives for achievement.  Weakness is unrealistic, overly idealistic, 
                overly empathetic, and lacking self-discipline and self-confidence.  I often spend too much time on others but myself, which leads me that I would often 
                think I am less valuable than others.  
                As for my learning style, it turns out to be that I am an auditory learner.  Over the years, I have thought I am a visual learner as I always learn and 
                gain information by watching news and videos.  Even when I watch TV and shows, I rely on the subtitles severely, not only in English but in my native language- 
                Mandarin Chinese.  If I want to learn well, I need to remember that I hear things instead of seeing things.</p>
            <h3>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>
            <p>I think it may influence my behaviour in a team in a good way as I wouldn't say I like confrontations and love group contribution, which means I am willing 
                to compromise or coordinate and collaborate with others despite different opinions to achieve the common goal.</p>
            <h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
            <p>When forming a team, we need to have everyone on the same page and share the common goal, which is to get an assignment/project accomplished.  
               This is not only benefiting others but us, so it is purpose-oriented.  Then we should encourage everyone to participate and contribute together to get our job 
               done.</p>
