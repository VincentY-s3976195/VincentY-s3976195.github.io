        <h3>A description (in your own words) of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to you.</h3>
            <p>Honestly, I have not decided which field I would like to go down yet.  Perhaps I am still new to this industry and have not gained enough 
               knowledge and information to recognise which part suits me better.  To me, software programming is interesting and requires in-depth programming
               skills so that you can see what is going on and it is achieving.  On the opposite, cyber security is quite different from software development 
               which protects an organisation's networks and computer systems by identifying problems, evaluating security issues, assessing risk, and 
               implementing solutions to address threats.  it is exciting and challenging, and rewarding as well.  Therefore, here I chose a position as a 
               Software Engineer to be my ideal job or a goal I would like to achieve eventually.  A Software Engineer is to design, develop and maintain 
               software systems.  What it appeals to me is that it provides a place for you to develop your creativity and it is a fulfilling and challenging 
               career and rewarding salary.</p>
        <h3>A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.</h3>
            <p>Qualification: Must have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Software Engineering, Information Technology and relevant majors.
               Working experience: 5 years experience in IT.
               Skills: The required programming skills for you to develop a new program that the company needs, problem-solving skills so you can test, 
               debug, diagnose and correct errors and faults, maintain the program and system and provide advice, guidance and expertise. </p>
        <h3>A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have.</h3>
            <p>Unfortunately, I do not have any relevant IT or cyber security skills or qualifications and experiences currently.  The only skill I would 
               say I have might be the ability to problem-solving throughout my years of work experience.  And this is the reason I started studying for a Bachelor's 
               degree in Information Technology. </p>
        <h3>A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, building on those you have now. This need not 
            be greatly detailed, (and will probably change significantly over time anyway), but try to be as specific as you can.</h3> 
            <p>My plan for an ideal job as a Software Engineer in my career path would be to attain the programming languages HTML and CSS, Java, JavaScript and Python at
               first and try to get an internship or initial experience in an entry-level Information Technology position during my second year or third year of my degree.
               And trying to get a job as a software developer and then brush up on my skills to be an engineer while learning relevant programming languages such as C/C++/C#, 
               Ruby, PHP etc., as much as possible to gain appropriate information certifications.  </p>
