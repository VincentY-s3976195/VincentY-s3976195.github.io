        <h1>Interest IT</h1>
        <h3>What is your interest in IT? </h3>
        <p>My interests in IT are software programming, networking, and cyber security.  I am interested in IT because it creates a virtual world, 
           and it becomes a reality and coexists with us that we even live.  </p>
        <h3>When did your interest in IT start?</h3>
        <p>It started when I started playing video and online computer games in my teens.  And it once drove me to study IT in school when 
           I was around 16 years old.  However, due to the concerns of parents and their expectations of their children, I did not study and therefore, 
           my path to IT has been divided since then.  </p>
        <h3>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</h3>
        <p>I would say Steve Jobs and all those IT guys in Sci-Fi or crime and action movies.  For the programming side, When I first used Apple products,
           I was fascinated by their appearance and features.  It is different from Microsoft products.  It amazed me, and I thought the interface and 
           functions could be attractive, user-friendly and various.  For cyber security and networking, I would say that I would always be excited about 
           how they successfully stopped the cyberattacks from those malicious hackers when I see the movies.  Not to mention I am interested in hacking 
           skills as well.  </p>
        <h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3> 
        <p>I have always wanted to take advanced studies to improve myself by learning a new skill to change my career.  However, being in multiple 
           roles in my life and concerned with reality, I had to put this idea of studying aside and wait.  And I have known Open University Australia 
           for years, and this year, I think I may be ready to study, and I contacted them, then here I am.  </p>
        <h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
        <p>I expect to learn the general knowledge of IT at first, and then I can analyse and consider which interests me more and suits me so that 
           I can specialise in one field or two.  </p>
